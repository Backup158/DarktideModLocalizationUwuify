# DarktideModLocalizationUwuify
Script for Warhammer 40,000 Darktide mods to uwuify text in descriptions

# What descriptions?
In every mod, there is a file called `<mod name>_localization.lua` which contains localization values for text displayed to the user, accessed using variables the author has defined. This supports multiple languages, but this script only uwuifies the English localizations.

The localization file is usually found in a folder along the lines of `<Darktide mods folder>/<mod name>/scripts/mods/<mod name>`

# Usage
Basically the instructions from my [Enhanced Descriptions UwUifier](https://github.com/Backup158/DarktideBetterDescriptionsUwuify) but without steps 3-4. TL;DR run it through the terminal and check the issues section.
